I am excited to work with you over the coming 12 weeks to explore the foundations of Computer Science ( CS ) .\\nIf you wish to contact me by email then use: ab3735 at coventry.ac.uk .\\nYou can also message me on Aula or Teams .\\nab3735 at coventry.ac.uk\\nMy office hours can be found at https://webeec01.coventry.ac.uk/DLC/timetable .\\nOur main aim in 5000CMD is to study the foundations of Computer Science ( CS ).\\nThis means we will use abstraction to describe our \"computation machines\" then make conclusions and predictions about their abilities and limitations.\\nTeaching and Learning P\\nEach week we start with a pre-class activity which you do on your own, to get you started thinking on the week\\'s topic.\\nWe then go into the lecture . You get slides (PDF format) and a series of videos that go through the slides to explain them in detail. Material for these can be found under d Weekly materials in the left-side navigation bar.\\nWe then go into the lecture . You get slides (PDF format) and a series of videos that go through the slides to explain them in detail.\\nMaterial for these can be found under d Weekly materials in the left-side navigation bar.\\nThere is a \"live lecture\" on Wednesdays 11am-1pm in ECG-24 .\\nThese cover the theory and show some examples.\\nThere is a \"live lecture\" on Wednesdays 11am-1pm in ECG-24 .\\nThese cover the theory and show some examples.\\nPre-recorded lectures can be accessed online.\\nThese have been broken such that each video covers one or a small number of related topics.\\nThe lab then follows with exercises. These are split into 3 levels (with increasing level of challenge), and hints are given to guide you.\\nThe labs give you the opportunity to practise and study the lectures\\' material. You are meant to try the exercises on your own, before the timetabled session, and then discuss your work in the lab and/or seek help with anything you have left.\\nWritten solutions are released at the end of the week. Videos to further explain some selected exercises are also provided, and more may be produced upon request.\\nFinally, you are encouraged to reflect on the week\\'s learning.\\nAll of the week\\'s activities are important.\\nIn particular, reflection is very important because it helps you link the various topics together, and makes you ponder on the real meaning of what you have studied abstractly, and link it back to the practical aspects.\\nYou can find more details at:\\nIntroductory video P\\nPlease watch the following introductory video to learn more about what to expect over the next 12 weeks.\\nPlease note that this was recorded during the period when we were doing remote teaching. Some details about delivery are now different because we are back to face-to-face teaching.\\nI want to know more... P\\nPlease look at the Module Guide for details on\\nthe aim of the module ,\\nthe Intended Module Learning Outcomes (ILOs),\\nthe weekly learning schedule ,\\nand some resources that you can use (Reading list and JFLAP ).\\nVisit the Module Guide page'})"
